# Motivation

When entering the workforce or looking for new job opportunities we have all been in the task of creating or updating our resume and almost always the main tool is Word, Canva or Adobe Illustrator. The last two options, although they offer a lot of customization in terms of design, do not allow much flexibility when updating information or easily adapting to a workflow. On the other hand, Word has templates with somewhat bland designs and the constant struggle with alignments, indents and styles when entering new information.
